# Vintage Terminal #

Use a terminal in style, like in the good old days! Vintage Terminal is a terminal emulator that simulates the looks of a 1980s monitor.

**Vintage Terminal requires the [SDL library](http://www.libsdl.org/), the [AO library](http://www.xiph.org/ao/) and [libconfig++](http://www.hyperrealm.com/libconfig/).**

Vintage Terminal has the following features:

  * Full terminal capabilities implemented;
  * Scaling (zoom) with the argument `-s`;
  * Window resize/maximize;
  * Full screen (`CTRL + F11`) and full screen with 80 columns (`CTRL + SHIFT + F11`);
  * UNICODE support (no unicode font yet);
  * Terminal rollback;
  * Mouse support **(new in 0.5.0)**;
  * Has a authentic old look based on a IBM 5151 monitor.

See more [Screenshots](Screenshots.md)!

This is a very early alpha release, so is not yet for the faint of heart. **USE AT YOUR OWN RISK.**

The following features are planned, in no particular order:

  * Different colors for the monochrome monitor (ambar, blue, gray...)
  * Different types of old monitors (DEC terminals, TV...)
  * Ability to configure every aspect of the image
  * MS-DOS console emulation for Windows

`Vintage Terminal` has only been tested on Linux so far. Some people reported that is works on MacOSX also -- see INSTALL file for details.
